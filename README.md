### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is eponra!
#### I was a bang & olufsen specialist for 17y, i did small scale IT (less than 50 workplaces) during that time for the last 15y, and am now full-time IT. I am also a maker and regular in the #3D printing discord since 2018.
Also, i like to design, engineer and build machines and applications...

I was lately featured on an article on all3dp, which im very proud of:

https://all3dp.com/4/check-out-the-collapsible-compact-flatpack-3d-printer/ 

Now a year has gone by, and a company named Mellow, from where i also like to source all my parts from but have no affiliation with whatsoever, has decided to make a printer based on my design:
- apparently called Mellow M1 (could be a working title though)
- crowdfound starts probably in november or decembre
- featuring a new board which is basically a Fly D5 and a Fly Pi Lite v2 married together on the size of the D5 (im very much looking forward to that board, apart from the cnc'ed version of my design
is running Flipper ofc; they could do rrf, but we will see
- is running a 2.8" touchscreen at the bottom, and a 1.3" touchscreen at the hotend for quick filament changes and quick heating
